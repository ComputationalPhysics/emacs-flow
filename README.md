# Emacs Flow

Offers Emacs-like indentation functionality.

## Installation

The package can be installed by using the Settings screen and searching for `emacs-flow`.

It can also be installed from the command line with the command:

```bash
apm install emacs-flow
```

## Use

### Auto Indenting the Current Line

With the default keymapping, just press <kbd>TAB</kbd> anywhere on the line you're on to automatically indent it to the proper depth. This feature is *highly* dependent on the current syntax definition being implemented properly.

## Configuration

Emacs Flow has no configuration options at this time.

## Keybinding

I have set the following keybindings for this package:

* <kbd>TAB</kbd> &mdash; Auto-indents the current line in the active editor
